The first assignment is straight forward, but will use it to get familiar with Github and using a markup. After doing some reasearch I decided to go with readme **readme.so** Readme is a software easy to use, it offers all kind options when explaining an assignment and we can see the final document at the same time that we are writing our notes.


# Assignment 1: Hello World!

This file contains a python program that displays "Hello World!" when it is run.
This assignment was very straight forward. But I have to mention that getting there was a bit complicated. Working with a Macbook Air 2015 I realized that my python software needed an update as it was still running on an outdated version of python 2 and I need to update it to a compatible version. Through https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ I downloaded the version of Python 3.9.6. Once done I still had two issues:
1.- I had to enable zsh instead of bash 
2.- Because I still had both versions of python on my computer and the old version was being exectued when executing python, I had to set python 3 as default from my terminal: 
$ alias python=/usr/bin/python3.9.6
then checked the version again: 
$ python --version
Python 3.9.6
It works!

# Assignment 2: Create a program named bank.py
a.-The program will prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent). 
b.-Add the two amounts.
c.-Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount. 
I assigned n_1 to the first amount (65) and n_2 to the second amount (180). 
In order to make it prompt I used the function input() and put between quotation marks "amount 1: " and "amount 2: " respectively that will propmt to introduce the amounts. It was necessary to leave a space after the two points to have a space between the number and the two points once we introduce the number.
I was looking for a way to show the word "cents" after adding the amount but it didn't work, I decided to add a new command print print(f'{n_1} cent') after input. In this task I also decided to use the f-string, I believe this makes the syntax more elegant than using print(int(n_1), 'cent')
Because 1â‚¬ is 100 cents. We would just need to add n_1+n_2 and divide by 100.

# Assignment 5: Create a program named weekday.py 
Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
If weekday, program will output 'Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.'
If weekend, program will output 'It is the weekend, yay!'


First I needed to find a way to input today's date. 
For that we need to import date from datetime module, whih means that we will have today's exact date, that is:
from datetime import date
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/current-datetime

from datetime import date
Date,date is an object that represents the actual Gregorian date. Every time an object is created a method (method is basically a function that belongs to an object) is called and it's named constructor, in this case we used the constructors today() and weekday(). 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
https://pythonbasics.org/constructor/
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#:~:text=A%20method%20is%20a%20function,%2C%20sort%2C%20and%20so%20on. (method defini)

Now we will create a variable that will define the object date:
today = date.today()

I decided to use if -else statement combined with the boolean operator 'OR', so I included the 5 days of the week in the if statement next to the variable today and added the constructor weekday(), weekday defines the days of the week assigning each day a number that go from 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday).
Then I added the numbers next to the == operator, that means that today's date will be True whenever the number of the weekday is equal to one of the numbers I added which go from 0 to 4 (Mon - Fri)
To define that it can be only one of these days I added the boolean operator OR:
https://realpython.com/python-or-operator/#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20the%20Python%20or,regardless%20of%20its%20truth%20value.&text=In%20this%20example%2C%20the%20Python,how%20or%20works%20in%20Python.
Then we added print() right after, that means that if any of these values is True, then the string that contains 'Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.' will be printed.
Otherwise, if all these values are False, then we would jump to -else statement, which could be Saturday or Sunday, we don't need to define those as we already defined the days Monday to Friday and any value that does not correspond to these will print the string 'It is the weekend, yay!'
When I finished this program I realised that I could invert it to make it shorter, that means instead of assigning the five days of the week to a number, I could actually just assign Saturday to (5) and Sunday (6). That is:
Instead of:
if today.weekday()==0 or today.weekday()==1 or today.weekday()=2 or today.weekday()==3 or today.weekday()==4:
    print('Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday')
else:
    print('It is the weekend, yay!')
Better:
if today.weekday()==5 or today.weekday()==6:
    print('It is the weekend, yay!')
else:
    print('Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday')
