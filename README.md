The first assignment is straight forward, but will use it to get familiar with Github and using a markup. After doing some reasearch I decided to go with readme **readme.so** Readme is a software easy to use, it offers all kind options when explaining an assignment and we can see the final document at the same time that we are writing our notes.


# Assignment 1: Hello World!

This file contains a python program that displays "Hello World!" when it is run.
This assignment was very straight forward. But I have to mention that getting there was a bit complicated. Working with a Macbook Air 2015 I realized that my python software needed an update as it was still running on an outdated version of python 2 and I need to update it to a compatible version. Through https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ I downloaded the version of Python 3.9.6. Once done I still had two issues:
1.- I had to enable zsh instead of bash 
2.- Because I still had both versions of python on my computer and the old version was being exectued when executing python, I had to set python 3 as default from my terminal: 
$ alias python=/usr/bin/python3.9.6
then checked the version again: 
$ python --version
Python 3.9.6
It worked!
